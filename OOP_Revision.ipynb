    "\n",
    "- ```Product```: Resembles a product in the store. We need to know the name, code, price and available quantity of the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```Order```: An order of products. It has customer name, product types and quantities, order date and total price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```Store```: This is our store. It should hold an inventory of products and a record of orders, as well as functions to add new products, make an order, show an order and show available products."
